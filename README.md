# Sing with Me

Sing with Me is a Java-based application which aims to enhance the musicality of the tone deaf by training their ablities to sing different notes. The app applies the AMDF pitch detection algorithm to recognize the fequencies of human voices. Capable of pre-demo and simultaneous comparison with standard notes to improve users' pitching accuracy. The app functions with data conversions between frequencies and notes, and supports real-time display of a note graph on the javaFX platform.

## Future Improvement

#### 1. Algorithm Optimization
Evaluate the accuracy of the model on different types of audio input. Explore the best algorithms and adjust pitch processors among different pitch detection methods (weighted autocorrelation, AMDF, ASDF), frequency domain analysis (FFTs) and composite methods (YIN, RAPT, YAAPT) to optimize the performance.

TarsosDSP is a Java library for audio processing. TarsosDSP features an implementation of a percussion onset detector and a number of pitch detection algorithms: YIN, the Mcleod Pitch method and a “Dynamic Wavelet Algorithm Pitch Tracking” algorithm. Also included is a Goertzel DTMF decoding algorithm, a time stretch algorithm (WSOLA), resampling, filters, simple synthesis, some audio effects, and a pitch shifting algorithm.
