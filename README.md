# Sing with Me

Sing with Me is a Java-based application which aims to enhance the musicality of the tone deaf by training their ablities to sing different notes. The app applies the AMDF pitch detection algorithm to recognize the fequencies of human voices. Capable of pre-demo and simultaneous comparison with standard notes to improve users' pitching accuracy. The app functions with data conversions between frequencies and notes, and supports real-time display of a note graph on the javaFX platform.
